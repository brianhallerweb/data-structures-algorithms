### My collection of data structure and algorithm problems with Jest unit tests.

##### Each folder includes index.js, solution.js, and test.js.

##### index.js gives instructions, constraints, and the opportunity to write your own solution. 

##### solution.js shows examples of possible solutions. 

##### test.js includes unit tests written in Jest. To run the tests: 
```$ npm test /folder-name/test.js```
