### My collection of data structure and algorithm problems with Jest unit tests.

#### Each folder contains 3 files: index.js, solution.js, and test.js.

index.js gives instructions, constraints, and the opportunity to write your own solution. 

solution.js shows examples of possible solutions. 

test.js includes unit tests written in Jest. 

To run the tests: 
```$ npm test /folder-name/test.js```
